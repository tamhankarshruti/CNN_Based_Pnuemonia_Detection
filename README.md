# CNN_Based_Pnuemonia_Detection
Built a CNN model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Preprocessed image data with resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to improve model generalization and robustness. Integrated the model into a web application using Flask, allowing real-time predictions through an interactive user interface.
